        "- The main difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how they execute code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compiled Languages\n",
        "  - The code is translated into machine code before execution using a compiler.\n",
        "  - The compiler produces an executable file, which can run independently of the source code.\n",
        "  - Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go\n",
        "  - Pros: Faster execution, better optimization, no need for an interpreter at runtime.\n",
        "  - Cons: Slower development cycle (compilation takes time), platform-dependent executables.\n",
        "- Interpreted Languages\n",
        "  - The code is executed line by line at runtime using an interpreter.\n",
        "  - No separate compilation step; execution happens dynamically.\n",
        "  - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP\n",
        "  - Pros: Easier debugging, more flexible, platform-independent.\n",
        "  - Cons: Slower execution since code is translated on the fly, dependent on the interpreter\n",

        "- Exception Handling (Theory)\n",
        "  - Exception handling is a mechanism that allows programs to handle runtime errors gracefully instead of crashing. It separates normal execution from error handling, improving stability and maintainability.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- Purpose of the finally Block in Exception Handling\n",
        "  - The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It ensures that cleanup operations (e.g., closing files, releasing resources) always run.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging in Python\n",

        " - Loads the entire module into memory.\n",
        " - Functions and variables must be accessed using the module name (module.function).\n",
        " - Encapsulates names, reducing the risk of conflicts.\n",
        "- from module import name (Selective Import)\n",
        "\n",
        " - Imports specific components directly into the current namespace.\n",

        "In exception handling theory, multiple exceptions can be managed using structured mechanisms to ensure robust error handling without program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Multiple except Blocks\n",
        " - Each except block handles a specific exception separately, making error resolution clearer.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Advantage: Granular control over each exception type.\n",
        " - Disadvantage: Can be verbose if many exceptions are expected.\n",

        " - A single except block can handle multiple related exceptions using a tuple.\n",
        "\n",

        " - Disadvantage: May hide unexpected errors, making debugging harder.\n",
        " 4. Using else and finally\n",
        " - else: Runs if no exception occurs, ensuring clean logic separation.\n",
        " - finally: Executes always, useful for cleanup operations.\n",

        " - Runs multiple threads within a single process.\n",
        " - Threads share memory and resources, making communication between them efficient.\n",
        " - In Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), only one thread executes at a time, preventing true parallel execution in CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        " - Best for: I/O-bound operations (e.g., file handling, web scraping, network requests).\n",
        "- Multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        " - Runs multiple processes, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter.\n",

        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python’s garbage collection (GC) system automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects, preventing memory leaks. It works using:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Reference Counting\n",
        " - Each object has a reference count (number of variables pointing to it).\n",
        " - When the count reaches zero, the memory is freed.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Cyclic Garbage Collection\n",
        " - Detects circular references (e.g., objects referencing each other).\n",
        " - Python’s gc module periodically scans and removes such cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Generational Garbage Collection\n",
        " - Objects are divided into three generations (young, middle-aged, old).\n",
